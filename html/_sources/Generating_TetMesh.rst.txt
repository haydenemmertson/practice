Generating a Tetrahedral Mesh
===============================

After identifying the geometry or making the proper adjustments to make it sweepable, a tetrahedral mesh must be generated. This tetrahedral mesh is used as the input of the sweeping algorithm. Instead of an .stl or .prt to define the object, this algorithm used a .inp as the input. This .inp file can be obtained either through Coreform Cubit or Gmsh.
